CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style HTML elements. It controls the look and layout of a web page. By using CSS, you can change the colors, fonts, spacing, and more, without having to modify the HTML structure.

Role of CSS in Web Development
Separation of Concerns: CSS separates the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), making the code easier to maintain and understand.
Consistent Styling: CSS allows you to apply the same styles to multiple elements on a page, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
Responsiveness: CSS can be used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
Customization: CSS offers a high degree of customization, allowing you to create unique and visually appealing web pages.
Creating a Simple HTML Document with CSS
HTML Document (index.html):

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Simple Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html> Â  

Use code with caution.

CSS Stylesheet (style.css):

CSS
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 36px;
}

p {
    color: darkblue;
    font-size: 18px;
}
Use code with caution.

Explanation of CSS Code
Selectors: The selectors (body, h1, p) specify which HTML elements the styles will be applied to.
Properties: The properties (background-color, color, font-size) determine the specific style attributes.
Values: The values (lightblue, red, 36px, darkblue, 18px) set the desired values for each property.
How the CSS Affects the HTML Elements
body selector: Sets the background color of the entire page to light blue.
h1 selector: Changes the text color of the <h1> element to red and increases the font size to 36 pixels.
p selector: Sets the text color of the <p> element to dark blue and reduces the font size to 18 pixels.
By combining the HTML and CSS, you can create a visually appealing web page with customized styles.

Definition of CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the visual presentation of web pages by specifying styles like colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. CSS allows developers to separate content (HTML) from design (CSS), making web development more efficient and maintainable.

Role of CSS in Web Development
CSS plays an important role in web development as it:

Improves visual design: CSS makes web pages visually appealing by controlling the layout, fonts, and colors.
Enhances user experience: With responsive CSS, web pages can adjust to different screen sizes and devices, providing a better experience.
Simplifies development: CSS reduces duplication by applying styles across multiple pages or elements with ease.
HTML Document with Basic CSS
Here's an example of an HTML document that includes a basic CSS stylesheet to change the background color, text color, and font size of the page:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Basic CSS Example</title>
    <!-- Link to the external CSS file -->
    <style>
        /* CSS Styles */
        body {
            background-color: lightblue; /* Sets the background color of the page */
            color: darkblue; /* Sets the text color for all elements */
            font-size: 18px; /* Sets the font size for the text on the page */
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif; /* Specifies the font family for the text */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a simple page styled with CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>
Explanation of the CSS Code
body {}: This is a CSS selector that targets the <body> element of the HTML document. All the styles inside this block will be applied to the entire webpage.

background-color: lightblue;: This sets the background color of the web page to light blue.
color: darkblue;: This changes the text color of all elements on the page (like headings, paragraphs, etc.) to dark blue.
font-size: 18px;: This defines the size of the text. In this case, it is set to 18 pixels for all the text on the page.
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;: This specifies the font family for the text. If Arial is not available, the browser will fall back to a generic sans-serif font.
Effect on HTML Elements
The background of the entire webpage will become light blue.
All the text (including headings and paragraphs) will be displayed in dark blue.
The font size for the text will be 18px, ensuring readability.
The font family will be Arial (or a similar sans-serif font if Arial is unavailable).
By using CSS, you can easily modify the appearance of HTML elements without affecting the structure or content.
