CSS Selectors: Targeting Elements
CSS selectors are used to specify which HTML elements should be affected by CSS rules. They act as a way to identify and target specific elements within a web page.

Types of Selectors
Element Selectors: Target elements based on their tag name.

Example: h1 targets all <h1> elements.
Class Selectors: Target elements based on their class attribute.

Example: .my-class targets all elements with the class attribute "my-class".
ID Selectors: Target a single element based on its unique ID attribute.

Example: #my-id targets the element with the ID attribute "my-id".
Attribute Selectors: Target elements based on their attributes and their values.

Examples:
[href] targets all elements with an href attribute.
[type="button"] targets all elements with the type attribute equal to "button".
Pseudo-Classes: Target elements based on their state or condition.

Examples:
:hover targets an element when the mouse hovers over it.
:active targets an element when it is clicked.
:focus targets an element when it has keyboard focus.
Example HTML Document
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>CSS Selectors Example</title>
    <style>
        /* Element selector */
        h1 {
            color: blue;
        }

        /* Class selector */
        .my-class {
            font-size: 24px;
        }

        /* ID selector */
        #my-id {
            background-color: yellow;
        }

        /* Attribute selector */
        a[href] {
            text-decoration: underline;
        }

        /* Pseudo-class selector */
        button:hover {
            background-color: lightgray;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>

    <p class="my-class">This is a paragraph with the "my-class" class.</p>

    <div id="my-id">This is a div with the "my-id" ID.</div>

    <a href="https://example.com">This is a link</a>

    <button>Click me</button>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

Explanation of How the Selectors Target Elements
The h1 selector targets all <h1> elements, changing their color to blue.
The .my-class selector targets all elements with the class attribute "my-class", increasing their font size to 24 pixels.
The #my-id selector targets the single element with the ID attribute "my-id", changing its background color to yellow.
The a[href] selector targets all elements with an href attribute, underlining their text.
The button:hover selector targets a button element when the mouse hovers over it, changing its background color to light gray.
By understanding and effectively using CSS selectors, you can precisely target and style specific elements within your web pages.

CSS Selectors: Definition and How They Work
CSS selectors are patterns used to select and target HTML elements that you want to style. They allow you to apply specific styles to elements based on their name, attributes, classes, IDs, or even their state (e.g., when a user hovers over them).

Common CSS Selectors
Element Selector: Targets all HTML elements of a specific type (e.g., p for paragraphs).

Class Selector: Targets all elements with a specific class attribute. Classes can be reused across multiple elements.

ID Selector: Targets a single element with a unique id attribute. Each ID must be unique within the HTML document.

Attribute Selector: Targets elements with a specific attribute and optionally its value (e.g., [type="text"] for input fields with type="text").

Pseudo-Classes: Targets elements based on their state (e.g., :hover for when the user hovers over an element).

Explanation of Each CSS Selector
Element Selector (p):

css
Copy code
p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 16px;
}
Targets all <p> elements on the page and sets their text color to blue and their font size to 16px.
Class Selector (.highlight):

css
Copy code
.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
    font-weight: bold;
}
Targets all elements with the class highlight, setting their background color to yellow and making the text bold.
In this example, the second paragraph has this class applied.
ID Selector (#intro):

css
Copy code
#intro {
    font-size: 20px;
    color: darkgreen;
}
Targets the element with the ID intro. IDs are unique, so only one element can be selected with this rule.
In the example, the third paragraph is styled this way.
Attribute Selector (input[type="text"]):

css
Copy code
input[type="text"] {
    border: 2px solid red;
    padding: 5px;
}
Targets all <input> elements where the type attribute is set to "text".
In the example, the input field with type="text" has a red border and 5px of padding around the text inside.
Pseudo-Class Selector (a:hover):

css
Copy code
a:hover {
    color: orange;
    text-decoration: underline;
}

Targets <a> elements when the user hovers over them. The color changes to orange and the text is underlined.
In the example, this effect is applied to the link when it is hovered over.
Summary of Selector Usage
. Element Selector: Targets all elements of a specific type. Good for global styling (e.g., all paragraphs).
. Class Selector: Targets multiple elements that share a class. Flexible and reusable for multiple elements.
. ID Selector: Targets a unique element. Use when you want to apply specific styles to one element.
. Attribute Selector: Targets elements based on their attributes and values. Useful for form styling and input controls.
. Pseudo-Class Selector: Targets elements in a specific state (e.g., when hovered). Good for interactive effects.
